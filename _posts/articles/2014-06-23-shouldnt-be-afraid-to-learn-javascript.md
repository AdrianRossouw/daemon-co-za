JavaScript is the language of the web. It's what every web browser understands, and what enables the advanced functionality and interactivity we've come to associate with modern websites. Technologies like HTML and CSS can *describe* the structure and aesthetics of a web application, but JavaScript is what makes an app come alive. There are many other technologies which can be used to build elements of a full-stack website, but I picked JavaScript for this series because it's the only programming language which can empower the whole stack -- from the user's browser all the way down to the server.

And yet, despite JavaScript's popularity and power, many web developers are afraid of it. They'd prefer to stay in the land of WordPress themes, assembling sites from pieces of functionality built by other developers, and relying on turnkey frameworks which abstract away the "complexity" of a web application.

I'd liken this to living in a foreign country for years, and yet getting by completely by pointing at things. Yes, you can probably order a croissant at a coffee shop with this methodology and a few well-timed grunts, but there are worlds of ideas and behavior you can't describe. By trying to keep things "simple," you've really limited yourself to "primitive."

Of course, there's a reason why tourists quickly revert to a primitive version of themselves when in a strange land: learning a language is *hard*. Learning JavaScript is hard, too, but if you want to become more than a tourist on the web, it's essential.

The good news is that, in many ways, learning a programming language is easier than learning a natural language. While a language like French has tens of thousands of words to memorize, a typical programming language only has few dozen core "vocabulary" words. The grammar rules of JavaScript might seem bizarre at first, but they're actually relatively straightforward and "sane" in comparison to language like English.

I'll cover more of the similarities and differences between programming and natural languages in the next article, but for now I want to concentrate on the most important elements in learning any language: immersion and confidence.

The classic difficulty in learning a foreign language is that it's hard learn quickly without constant feedback from native speakers -- the way a child learns -- and yet when you *are* around native speakers, it's hard to have the confidence to brazenly mangle their language right in front of them.

For some reason, we can carry these fears with us when attempting to learn a programming language, but we shouldn't! In truth, the only "native" speaker of a programming language is the computer which executes the code. While you want to learn how to write code which can be "understood" by yourself and other programmers, only a computer is capable of "running" a program, and therefore it's the ultimate arbiter of whether your code is "good" or not. And guess what: computers don't have feelings!

As a programmer, with over fifteen years of professional experience, I'm wrong all the time. With programming there are a multitude of ways to be wrong, and only one way to be right. When you make a mistake with a programming language, the computer spits out an error message and you can try again. There's no reason to be embarrassed. Nobody's waiting behind you in line at the coffee shop, rolling their eyes as you get the gender for latte wrong. Every time your computer returns with an error, it's a chance to learn what went wrong and become a better programmer.

Still, it can be frustrating. Computers can be very dumb, and sometimes their error messages might not make a lot of sense. How can you fix your program if you don't know what's broken? One of the reasons I'm teaching a "full stack" is so that you understand each part of a larger system. I want to eliminate the "magic" of web apps, so that when things don't work, you know what to point to.

With knowledge of the whole web stack, you'll be much better equipped to work with any single part. Are you a front-end designer? You'll know where your data comes from. Primarily work on the server side? You'll see how your API is consumed. And by learning JavaScript, you won't just be learning how to solve "browser" problems or "Node.js" problems, you'll be learning to solve "computer" problems.

Ultimately, what we want to do is translate our ideas into something the computer understands. JavaScript is simply a language -- a tool which lets us talk to the computer -- but the ideas present in JavaScript are what really matters, and have applications across all realms of computing.

So, where to start? There are countless resources to learn JavaScript, from [books](http://eloquentjavascript.net/), to [interactive tutorials](http://www.codecademy.com/), to an entire [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript). In order to follow along with this series, I recommend at least running through [Learn Javascript](http://gitbookio.github.io/javascript/), a basic and straightforward introduction.

What's important, as you learn, is to keep having conversation with your computer. Use tools like the Node.js REPL, Light Table, or your browser's console, to see exactly how your code behaves and what it means. If you don't understand something, tear it down into its component parts and examine the behavior of each piece. And remember: nobody's judging you. Don't be embarrassed, keep breaking things, and keep learning.
