<p><strong>This post has nothing to do with any technical similarity
between the two systems.</strong></p>
<p>It is the conclusion of a series of posts, in which
I have attempted to understand why my <a href='/2014/03/wrong-to-be-afraid-of-angular'>instincts were telling me to avoid
Angular.js</a> at all costs.</p>

### Conflicting Emotions

</div>

It's not something I really emphasize on my [online portfolio](/portfolio), but
I was actually a [__major contributor to Drupal__](https://drupal.org/node/956624). I don't think
it's hyperbolic to say that I was responsible for a lot of the parts of the framework
that could generally be considered some of the most quintessentially 'Drupal' api's.

It was only after almost 10 years with the project that I became aware that it's
growing complexity would eventually overwhelm me and become an obstacle to my future happiness.

It wasn't really Drupal's fault that I needed to leave, I think it is just any system
that gets to this level of complexity. I can work on this level for a while, but working
on this level every day will start to drain the colour out of my world, and is ultimately
not going to make me a better person.

I had invested so much of myself into Drupal, that it had become part of my identity.
Subsequently, stepping away from the project was one of the hardest things I had ever needed to do.

#### When I looked at Angular.js

<blockquote class='col-md-6'>
<h5>Consciously</h5>
<p>I saw the same endless potential that I had initially seen in Drupal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class='col-md-6'>
<h5>Subconsciously</h5>
<p>I dreaded feeling the way I had near the end of my time with Drupal.</p>

__I think it was this conflict that drove my need to properly evaluate Angular.js,
even if just to put my mind to rest.__

### Nature of my Intuition

    <img src='/img/drupalcon/amst2.png' />
</div>

I now believe that my intuition was, in a way, projecting my possible/likely emotional
state 6 (or maybe even up to 8) years down the line, if I were to invest myself or my time into this.
Basically, would I be happy doing this for a really long time?

The only way this extra sense could really develop is through personal experience and
if I hadn't had those experiences, I would probably have charged ahead, not thinking
about where I could be headed.

I can only really intellectually extrapolate how these types of systems could evolve
maybe 2-3 years down the line, and even then when I am wrong, I can acknowledge it
mostly on an intellectual level.

This form of intuition feels like I will really need to have experienced an outcome for
it to become more honed, and that means I will need to make more mistakes =)

### Why my intuition was wrong about Angular.js

{% include terms.html %}

With Drupal, my problem was that I came to realize there was no way I could make it
any __simpler__, while still doing what it was busy doing. It would never get any
__easier__ for me, ever again.

I think that Angular is very rare in that actually has real potential to become __simpler__
over time as the standards evolve. A lot of the things I was uncomfortable with,
such as dirty-checking observables, can eventually be removed entirely.

The last thing that set off my spidey-sense was the black magic dependency injection,
but even that is going to be gone in Angular 2.0. I really do think the developers know
what they are doing. I hope they will pick __simple__ over __easy__ whenever they can.

I am still not the model user for Angular, and I am still likely to use
Backbone when I have the choice, but I do look forward to seeing how
it evolves over time. 

### Did I learn anything?

Yeah, I'd say I did. I now know why certain types of tools have a visceral
reaction on me, and I've expanded my vocabulary in ways that will
aid me when discussing these topics in the future.

I've also realized that I still have a Drupal community sized hole in my heart. Those were
some of the happiest times of my life and I will always cherish them. I'd
like to think I left behind an Adrian sized hole too. _Pictures below are
from the first DrupalCon I missed, and therefor was carried around in effigy by my friends._

But I also know that leaving was the right thing for me to do, and I am
in a much better place than I would have been otherwise.

Nowadays, I actively try to do less, and I pick my battles more carefully.
