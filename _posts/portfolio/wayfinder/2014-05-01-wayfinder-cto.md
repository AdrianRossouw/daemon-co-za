Responsible for the design and implementation of a distinctive knowledge sharing tool oriented around building narrative around lists of links.

Lead our team of five full-stack developers in the process of migrating to a microservice based architecture, with a brand new front-end written in React.js. The devops side was handled by a custom Docker based tool that we used to deploy all our services.
