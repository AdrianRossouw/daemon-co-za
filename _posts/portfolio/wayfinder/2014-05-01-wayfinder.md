Wayfinder is a tool that allows you to collect several links on a subject into one page that can be shared with others. I first discovered the product as a user, and joined to help build a next iteration of it.

We replaced the ember front-end with a much cleaner and simpler react-based one and migrated from a monolithic architecture on the back-end, to a microservices one.
We also needed to build a custom Docker-based tool to manage the deployment of our microservices.

This allowed us to work on individual parts of the system without greatly affecting other developers with our changes.
