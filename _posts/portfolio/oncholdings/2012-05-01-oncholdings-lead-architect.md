ONCHoldings provides online simulation and decision support platforms. This technology powers products that enable businesses, consumers and institutions to quantify complex processes and receive actionable guidance that increase the likelihood of success and decrease costs.

I am employee #1, and the design and implementation of our critical systems is my primary responsibility. My other tasks include representing the engineering department in decisions of a technical nature, and helping to manage the team of developers working for us.

The problem space we operate in is both interesting, and vast. Because of that, I am given the opportunity to expand my horizons beyond my primary toolchain of javascript and node.js, and into areas like industrial psychology, statistical analysis and business process management.

We are in the process of formalizing and eventually open sourcing the framework we have evolved to help us solve these problems, in a way that is both highly distributed and modular.
