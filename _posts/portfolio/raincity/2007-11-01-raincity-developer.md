Responsible for the maintenance of the hosting system I had built before being acquired.

I was also tasked with a completely rewritten replacement for the aging system, that took into account all the lessons we had learned, and would allow for us to offer more functionality to our clients.

The system (eventually known as the [Aegir hosting system](http://aegirproject.org)) was feature complete and deployed to staging when the company went bankrupt.

I continued working on this project on my own time, for several months afterwards. I was able to get sponsorship for the growing open source product through employment by
Development Seed.
