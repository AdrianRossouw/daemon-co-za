Bryght was the first Drupal services company, co-founded by myself and some other developers.

I built and maintained a PaaS at bryght.com, that allowed for turnkey deployment of Drupal sites.

To monetize this system I also built a custom ecommerce solution, with reseller capabilities, to allow for recurring payment
of the sites.

Part of my responsibilities were to push through significant improvements to the Drupal platform,
and a large portion of my time was spent working directly on the Open Source underpinnings that drove
the company.

Bryght was [purchased by Raincity Studios](http://www.prweb.com/releases/raincity-studios/acquires-bryght/prweb571216.htm), our biggest client, in November of 2007.
