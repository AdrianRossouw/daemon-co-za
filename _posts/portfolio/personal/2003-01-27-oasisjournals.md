I had become involved with the Oasis community as a teenager because it helped me come to grips with my own sexuality, and in late 2002 the site suffered a catastrophic meltdown of the commercial CMS that the site was running on. I had been fiddling with [Drupal](http://drupal.org) in my spare time, and I took the opportunity to give back to the community that had already given me so much, by building a completely new site for them. I also designed the theme for this site.

While I am not actively involved with the site anymore, I still host and maintain it, as I have for nearly 10 years. I was rewarded hundreds of times- over for my charity, because it launched my career as a Drupal developer and broadened my horizons significantly. I owe a lot of what I have become to this little site, so it will always have a soft spot in my heart.
