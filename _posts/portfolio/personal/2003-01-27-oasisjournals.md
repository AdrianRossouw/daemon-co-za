I rescued an online community for queer and questioning youth I had been involved with as a teenager from complete collapse, after the commercial CMS used for the site suffered a catastrophic meltdown.

While I am not actively involved with the site anymore, I still host and maintain it, as I have for nearly 10 years.

I had been fiddling with [Drupal](http://drupal.org) in my spare time, and I took the opportunity to build a completely new site for them and also designed a new theme in the process.


Due to the social media revolution, and the nature of the site, very few of the hundreds of thousands of users remain very active on the site these days, so it has been decided to switch the site into archive mode on it's 19th birthay.
