Tumblr Picture Browser. I built this demo over a few weekends to experiment with a bunch of technologies that I was curious about.

This application will scrape entire sites to mirror them locally on a CouchDB database, and provides an Angular.js-based Couch-App as the front end.
It then integrates with an ElasticSearch to allow you to build faceted cross-blog searches on various fields. I also built
some rudimentary tablet support into the application.
