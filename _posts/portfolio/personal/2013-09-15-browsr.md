Tumblr Picture Browser. I built this demo over a few weekends to experiment with a bunch of technologies that I was curious about.

This application will scrape entire sites to mirror them locally on a CouchDB database, and provides an Angular.js-based Couch-App as the front end.
It then integrates with an ElasticSearch to allow you to build faceted cross-blog searches on various fields. I also built
some rudimentary tablet support into the application.

It is something of a re-implementation of the [Tumblr Collage chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tumblr-collage/fmfgcipfpihnkblbbemdagfdhjjeilli), which I felt became too unstable on larger image sites. The browser-based nature of the original extension means it wasn't really possible to implement things I really wanted, like saving your current location in a large collection of images.

At the urging of some friends I released it under an MIT license, with the side effect that I subsequently had users I needed to support with an upgrade path. I actually learnt a lot of useful
techniques from building this application, and I'm looking forward to my next tangle with Angular.js.
