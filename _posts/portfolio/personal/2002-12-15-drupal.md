I was deeply involved with the Drupal content management system for nearly a decade. I was responsible for the design of a series of APIs that became the very foundation of how the application evolved.

I attended nearly a dozen Drupalcon's around the world, and I presented to large crowds of developers at eight of those conferences.

I architected the entire theme layer, and how the various modules expose elements to be themed, and how those elements are overridden by various theme engines to allow the support of multiple templating languages.

I also built PHPTemplate, which became the de facto template engine used for all theming in Drupal, and was eventually included in core.

I designed, and managed the group who implemented the new 'Forms API' in Drupal 4.7, which added the ability for modules to interact and extend each other's forms and data submission processes.
