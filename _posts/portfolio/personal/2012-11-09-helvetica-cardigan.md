Realtime Collaborative Fridge Poetry. This demo application was built in 48 hours as our entry into the 2012 [Node Knockout Hackathon](http://nodeknockout.com).

Allows for a shared virtual fridge where all participants can re-arrange the words and have them be updated in realtime
on everybody else's screens. You are able to create and share custom fridges based on your own sets of words.

The team consisted of myself and another local node.js developer: [Le Roux Bodenstein](http://twitter.com/lerouxb). I focused on the back-end
and realtime data synchronization, and he built out the front end.

We did not submit the application for official voting because neither
of us were up to producing the demo video needed to be considered eligible after the long weekend.
