I started a local [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org) user group to meet other interested developers and grow the local community.

I built the website with Jekyll with some light front-end backbone.js code thrown in. I designed the logo using inkscape, and the css used bootstrap as a base, but doesn't look like yet-another-bootstrap site.
