I founded a [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org) user group in Cape Town to meet similarly interested developers and grow the local community.

I have since handed over the maintainership of the user group to one of the members, as I was no longer able to set aside the time to organize everything. 

<!--more-->

I built the website with Jekyll with some light front-end backbone.js code thrown in. I designed the logo using inkscape, and the css used bootstrap as a base, but doesn't look like yet-another-bootstrap site.

They still meet up, but other than giving the odd presentation to the group I am no longer really involved.
