Aegir is an open source project that I founded, that builds a cloud-based hosting platform for Drupal, using nothing but command-line PHP scripts and sheer determination.

I built a community around the project, and was able to successfully hand off the project to my co-maintainers when the project reached the 1.0 milestone.

You are able to use Aegir to manage a dev-staging-production workflow, and it was even able to be completely white-boxed and integrated into any niche you could build a Drupal site for.

It also provides more advanced features like provisioning sites across web clusters, migrating between said servers, provisioning DNS and SSL certificates for the sites.

In early 2004, I left my job to help found Bryght, one of the first Drupal service companies, with the ambition of building a hosted service with Drupal. I had a dream, and that dream was called "hostmaster". Over the next several years, the system I developed to accomplish this dream evolved into Aegir.

I started the Aegir project, in it's current form, out of a desire to ensure that my dream would be able to survive beyond my ability to dedicate myself to it. 

The goals of the project were an exercise in technological asceticism, as we resolved to avoid any additional dependencies beyond what Drupal required itself, or were commonly installed on a linux server.

I stepped away from the project because I was no longer an active user of the software I was developing, because I was not hosting all that many Drupal sites anymore.
