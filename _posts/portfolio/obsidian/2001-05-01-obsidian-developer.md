Obsidian was arguably the largest company in South Africa solely focused on Linux and Open Source.

My primary motivation for seeking employment with them was to be able to focus on various open source technologies, at a time when the majority of the local industry were tied to Microsoft products.

I was involved in a number of projects including multiple web portals written in PHP, a cross-platform desktop application written in Tcl/TK, and a touch screen point-of-sale system written in Python.
