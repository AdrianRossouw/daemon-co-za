I was initially employed as a means of funding the open source [Aegir project](http://aegirproject.org), that I had founded while working for my previous employer. I stayed on with them and transitioned into a more development support and system automation role, and eventually working with them on various client projects.

During my time with them we all made the decision to refocus our energies on Node.js, and proceeded to [find new maintainers for several successful open source products](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/feb/22/open-atrium-and-managing-news-acquired/) we had built using Drupal. They have built many data driven sites with very complex mapping components since then, and I was involved in many of their projects during that time.
