The Global Adaptation Index™ (GAIN™), a project of the [Global Adaption Institute](http://gain.org), provides a data-driven approach to help countries and the private sector invest in adaptation to climate change and other global forces.

<!--more-->

We led the strategy, design, and build of index.gain.org with private and public sector decision makers in mind as the main audience. At the same time we knew we needed to expose the inner workings of the index to researchers and subject matter experts.

Please see our [release announcement](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/09/15/global-adaptation-index-data-browser-launched/) for more information.
