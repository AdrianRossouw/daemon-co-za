The Global Adaptation Index™ (GAIN™), a project of the [Global Adaption Institute](http://gain.org), provides a data-driven approach to help countries and the private sector invest in adaptation to climate change and other global forces.

Climate change is a reality and the challenge is only increasing as population growth, urbanization and economic expansion continue. All countries must adapt in order to minimize the effects of climate change and other global forces. Despite expanding resource commitments from international institutions, public funding alone is not the solution. The private sector will play a key role in providing the necessary additional resources. GAIN offers information on a country's vulnerability and its readiness to undertake adaptive actions to prioritize and evaluate these needed investments.

We led the strategy, design, and build of index.gain.org with private and public sector decision makers in mind as the main audience. At the same time we knew we needed to expose the inner workings of the index to researchers and subject matter experts.

Please see our [release announcement](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2011/09/15/global-adaptation-index-data-browser-launched/) for more information.
