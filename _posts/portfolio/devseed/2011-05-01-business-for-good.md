The Business for Good Map shows where and how businesses are improving communities and lives all over the world. The platform is a tool for businesses to connect, find partners, discover ideas, and share best practices and lessons learned.

It's also a research hub and news source meant to increase transparency and raise awareness about the private sector's role in addressing issues such as education, diversity and inclusion, the environment, and global health.

The map is managed by the [Business Civic Leadership Center](http://bclc.uschamber.com/) (part of the [US Chamber of Commerce](http://uschamber.com)) and was designed in collaboration with BCLC's corporate members and a leading mapping team based in Washington DC, Development Seed.
