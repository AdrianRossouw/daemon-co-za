We partnered with the [Federal Education Budget Project](http://febp.newamerica.net) at the [New America Foundation](http://newamerica.net) to help better communicate how each U.S. school district compares to its surrounding districts, how it performs relative to other districts in its state, and how it compares to other schools in the country across a range of indicators. The custom data browser shows each school district on a map next to its neighbors using custom mapping tools.

The browser allows users to easily explore and compare education funding information. The site targets policy makers and the press with its unique data set - the site now reports on over 65 indicators for almost 14,000 public school districts in the United States and 7,500 higher education institutions. It is fast becoming a valued resource for parents and local officials as well.
