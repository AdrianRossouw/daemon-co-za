We partnered with the [Atlas Project](http://atlasproject.net) to build out the mapping component of their election data visualization toolkit.

The system allowed for the dynamic composition of maps from hundreds of data layers that represented every local or national election in the last several decades in the United States.

The data was further broken down into dozens of demographic indicators, allowing one to trace the shifting attitudes of various cross sections of society over time.
