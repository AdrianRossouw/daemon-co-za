Responsible for design and implementation of online simulation and decision support platforms. Making critical technology decisions about the entire system infrastructure, and ensuring that our code base is built in a manner that keeps our development team productive.

Publishing our development framework as an open source project named [Graft](http://github.com/ONCHoldings/graft.js), with the goal of encouraging our team to properly abstract the various components in a way that optimises our code base towards long term maintainability and more complete documentation.

The focus on writing tested and verifiable code, through the use of continuous integration is also bolstered by this practise. It also aids the on-boarding of more developers to the team, and allows more opportunities for code reuse.

GoBe.Me provides online simulation and decision support platforms. This technology powers products that enable businesses, consumers and institutions to quantify complex processes and receive actionable guidance that increase the likelihood of success and decrease costs.

The problem space is both interesting, and vast. Allowing me to expand my horizons beyond my primary toolchain of javascript and node.js, and into areas like industrial psychology, statistical analysis and business process management.
