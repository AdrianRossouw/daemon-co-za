Graft is an MVC framework released as an open source project to formalize the development methodology used by my development team at GoBe.Me.

My goal with this project was not to attract external users, but to encourage my team to properly abstract the various components in a way that optimises our code base towards long term maintainability and more complete documentation.

This approach has enabled us to concurrently develop prototypes of several related products in a number of different verticals.

The additional focus on writing tested and verifiable code, through the use of continuous integration is also bolstered by this practise, and it provides a significant benefit when needing to on-board new developers onto the team.
