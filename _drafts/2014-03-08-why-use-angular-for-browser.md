#### Angular.js

##### Motivation

At least for myself, a lot of my experience seems to have been integrated into my decision
making processes on a more emotional than strictly intellectual level.

It causes me to almost instinctively distrust things
that look automagical, because all I see now is how horribly that kind of thing can break down.

The closest term I know for this feeling is [code smell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell).

I had been looking at Angular on and off over the last few years, and for the most part I remained very skeptical about it.

What was troubling me about it was that my unease with angular was mostly operating on this emotional level, and I feel
really uncomfortable with making decisions based solely on my gut.

Now and then I force myself to prove my instincts are correct, but the times where I turned out to be wrong
are arguably some of the most valuable lessons I could have learnt.

So I guess you could say I picked Angular for this project because it scared me, and I needed to confirm these fears
for myself.

Interestingly, about a week or two before starting this project I had a dream in which I was building something using angular,
and I was having a lot of fun doing it. I hadn't really been looking at angular much recently, but this did kind
of push it to the forefront of my mind.

##### Outcome

I've never been happier to be proven wrong. I really really loved building this app in Angular.

The parts of Angular that worried me the most never caused me any trouble, and some of those are
even on the way to becoming official parts of the language.

There are still things that are just completely wrong, such as
having multiple ways to do dependency injection ... some of which break under minification and can
only be explained as a clever hack.

My experience with Angular has also made me very painfully aware of things in Backbone that I wouldn't
be struggling with if I were using it instead.

The most obvious example is the amount of work needed to ensure that events are aggregated correctly across the whole system.
At the same time, I am not sure that 2-way data binding for everything is the correct solution either.
