I am a full-stack javascript developer with nearly fifteen years of industry experience.

I have spent the last several years focusing my attentions on [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org), and have a [wide range of
experience]({{site.baseurl}}portfolio) in javascript and related technologies.

I have also been the co-founder of a PaaS startup, a [valued core contributor](https://drupal.org/node/956624) to
[large open source projects](http://drupal.org), and founded a [successful open source project](http://http://aegirproject.org) of my own.

I am based in __Cape Town, South Africa__, and have been working remotely since 2004.
