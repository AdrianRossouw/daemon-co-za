I am a seasoned technologist with [over twenty years of industry experience](/portfolio).

My strengths are building and managing remote-first teams to successfully execute on complex engineering projects.
While I have extensive experience as a software developer in a wide variety of industries, my main focus in the last decade has been expanding my leadership abilities and growing my soft-skills.

I have also been the co-founder of a PaaS startup, a [valued core contributor](https://drupal.org/node/956624) to
[large open source projects](http://drupal.org), and founded a [successful open source project](http://aegirproject.org) of my own.

I am based in Dublin, Ireland, and have been working remotely since 2004.
