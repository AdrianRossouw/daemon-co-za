Raincity Studios [purchased Bryght](http://www.prweb.com/releases/raincity-studios/acquires-bryght/prweb571216.htm) in November of 2007.

My responsibilities at the new company included the maintenance of the existing hosting system, but also building a completely rewritten replacement for the aging system, that took into account all the lessons we had learned, and would allow for us to offer more functionality to our clients.

The system (eventually known as the [Aegir hosting system](http://aegirproject.org)) was feature complete and deployed to staging when the company started disintegrating. I continued working on this project on my own time, for several months afterwards.
