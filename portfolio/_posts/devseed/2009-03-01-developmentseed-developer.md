DevelopmentSeed initially approached me with employment as a means of funding the open source [Aegir project](http://aegirproject.org), that I had founded during my employment with Raincity Studios.

After my initial contract ran it's course, I stayed on with the company adding additional system administration and workflow automation to my responsibilities. I was still primarily employed as a means to further my work on Aegir at the time.

In early 2011 the company (and myself) decided to abandon our current Drupal based stack, instead focusing on [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org) and server side javascript. Since then I have been involved in several client projects using these technologies, with a focus on building interactive data sites that have a geo/maps component to them.
